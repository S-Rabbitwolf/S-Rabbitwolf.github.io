		<p>Cured meat, Filipino style! My apologies to every vegan out there. I respect your tenacity, for I lack it.</p>

			<h2>What You'll Need:</h2>
			<ul>		
				<li>1-2 lbs pork (preferably flank meat)</li>
				<li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
				<li>1 1/2 tbsp salt</li>
				<li>3 cloves of minced garlic</li>
				<li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
				<li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
				<li>1/4 cup fruit juice (again, optional)</li>
				<li>1/2 tbsp ground black pepper</li>
				<li>1 tbsp rice flour (to give it that little extra texture!)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Instructions:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Combine every non-pork ingredient into an appropriately sized mixing bowl. Make sure everything is blended to your liking before moving on!</li>
				<li>Add the pork and hand-mix it. It's important to hand-mix it to ensure the meat isn't crushed or damaged. Use gloves, kids!</li>
				<li>Transfer it to a container with a cover, letting it sit overnight <em>unrefrigerated</em>.</li>
				<li>When you feel it's ready, mix it again before putting it in the fridge. You can keep it inside there for anywhere between 1-3 days, but my preference is just 1.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once that's complete, you gotta cook it! It's pretty much exactly like bacon in terms of its preparation after the intial prep.
				Get a pan, turn the stove on medium heat, and cook it until it's to your liking! Just... make sure it's not raw, alright?

			<h2>A little bit about why I like this stuff so much:</h2>
			<p>I'm sure you may be asking yourself, "S, this is just really thick bacon. Why in the world is this your favorite recipe?"
				<br>
				Well sport, I'm glad you asked. I was introduced to Filipino food through my ex-partner (it sure is nice to stay friends with people you care about!) and it kind of captured my heart. Tocino is something so remarkably simple, yet incredibly effective.
				There's nothing else to it, really.
				<br>
				In fact, I'd go so far as to say that simplicity often makes for the best kind of food. Simple foods allow you to combine with all sorts of stuff to try different combinations, seeing what works and what doesn't!
				<br>
				In many ways, that's kind of just like anything in life. Wouldn't you agree?
