                <h2>Sin of the Father, Cast Aside</h2>
                <p>Saikyo (or Sai, for short) is an uncannily proficient magician and tactician, born into a relatively unknown family. As magical prowess is often heavily documented
                    in Telna, his rise through the ranks of the Lunar Order came as a surprise to many in its upper circles. While many question his somewhat suspicious rise in status,
                    others view him as an exemplary model of an individual who came from nothing to achieve greatness.

                    In reality, Sai is not of the plane of Telna. A product of experimentation with soul tethering and interplanal traversal, he is the spiritual clone of his father, Osamu. Due to his upbringing and identity, he does not value himself very highly, and struggles with the concept of self-identification. This is amplified exponentially by the fact that his physical appearance near perfectly matches his father's. 

                    Due to a certain major incident, his soul was split in twain; one portion of his being remained in his home plane, and the other would wander aimlessly amidst the void. In this state of nothingness, he was discovered by a immensely powerful benefactor: The primordial Curator Dragon, Kalzakkotz.

                    After deeming Sai's soul worthy of preservation (for reasons unknown to Sai,) he was given a single task: Prevent the unification of Telna, a plane disconnected from the nexus of the Eidleik, the nexus of all creation. Should he fail, the delicate balance which preserves the cycle of life among all planes would likely be thrown into chaos, for reasons undisclosed.
