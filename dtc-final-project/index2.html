                    <h2>Sin of the Father, Cast Aside</h2>
                    <p>Saikyo (or Sai, for short) is an uncannily proficient magician and tactician, born into a
                        relatively unknown family. As magical prowess is often heavily documented
                        in Telna, his rise through the ranks of the Lunar Order came as a surprise to many in its upper
                        circles. While many question his somewhat suspicious rise in status,
                        others view him as an exemplary model of an individual who came from nothing to achieve
                        greatness.

                        In reality, Sai is not of the plane of Telna. A product of experimentation with soul tethering
                        and interplanal traversal, he is the spiritual clone of his father, Osamu. Due to his upbringing
                        and identity, he does not value himself very highly, and struggles with the concept of
                        self-identification. This is amplified exponentially by the fact that his physical appearance
                        near perfectly matches his father's.

                        Due to a certain major incident, his soul was split in twain; one portion of his being remained
                        in his home plane, and the other would wander aimlessly amidst the void. In this state of
                        nothingness, he drifted for what felt like eons, unthinking and unfeeling, until he was
                        discovered by a immensely powerful benefactor: The primordial Curator Dragon, Kalzakkotz.

                        After deeming Sai's soul worthy of preservation (for reasons unknown to him,) he was given a
                        single task: Prevent the unification of Telna, a plane disconnected from the nexus of the
                        Eidleik, the nexus of all creation. Should he fail, the delicate balance which preserves the
                        cycle of life among all planes would likely be thrown into chaos, for reasons undisclosed.

                        Finding himself on the plane of Telna after given his mission, his initial thoughts were that of
                        concern. He had never wanted to get involved in his father's matters of the soul, nor did he
                        feel particularly strongly about the prospect of maintaining life's balance, given his struggles
                        in ages past. However, it were these thoughts alone which motivated him to push onwards.

                        He cast aside his doubts and pressed onward. In his mind, this would be an opportunity to carve
                        a path for himself which was unjustly denied to him in life. For the first time in his
                        existence, Sai felt that he had a purpose outside of being in his father's shadow.

                        And that, in his mind, was more than enough. Even with this artificial, immortal body he had
                        been granted on that plane, he would do that which his father could not.

                        He would be someone to look up to, or die in the trying.

                        Would that he had known that fate set him on that path for a reason, through which his past and
                        uncertain future alike would meet him face-to-face in ways he would soon wish were not
                        possible...
