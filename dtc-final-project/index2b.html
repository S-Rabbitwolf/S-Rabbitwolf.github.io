                <h2>Finding Themself Without A Self</h2>
                <p>Setra Albastra is an enigma even among their home plane of Apotheosis. An artificial creation of the Eidleik's steward, Kei, their body is composed of a combination of both physical and ethereal matter.

                    Due to this unique composition granted to them by their creation, they have the ability to traverse the Eidleik's roots without damaging themselves in the process. This is by design; Setra's primary purpose is to track and summarily dispose of souls that are close to severing their connection to the roots.

                    As with most artificial bodies, Setra took quite a while to develop a personality outside of their directives. Over the years, they have come to develop a blunt, but sincere outlook on existence.

                    Their true purpose is to foster the resuscitation of the soul which lays dormant in their body. As a result, much of her personality and appearance is a direct reflection of that individual.

                    Setra has been dispatched to Telna to perform a familiar task; weed out a certain soul which has accumulated too much power to ignore, and reconnect the world to its roots.

                    However, unlike previous forays into the roots, a strange, familiar sensation fills Setra with an uncomfortable sense of urgency. Telna, being a world entirely disconnected from the Eidleik, should have nothing to elicit such a response.

                    Due to their nature, that familiarity would develop into a deeper curiosity, which would envelop Setra's attention. For the first time in their existence, it was not their assignment which drove them forward.

                    This curiosity would entangle this artificial being in ways that not even the gods would predict.
