                                    Most of it is directly related to how he feels his accomplishments are pointless, but there's a small part of him that hopes his luck runs out one day.
                                    That being said, he still enjoys those activities regardless of their purpose. In his mind, he only has one life to live, so he may as well keep things interesting.

                <h2>Allergic to Failure</h2>
                <p>Boyd Traverse is what many would consider to be an edge case in success. Many take shortcuts, or attempt to find ways to circumvent the way the world works through a variety of means.

                    Boyd, quite simply, doesn't care. Or rather, he couldn't really be made to care. He has an oxymoronic lifestyle born of an uncharacteristically high amount of luck, with charisma ill-fitting of someone with his outlook on life.

                    Born in a poor fishing town in Prime, the largest nation in the world of Apotheosis, Boyd exhuded a rather uncanny approach to many of the tasks given to him by his father. No matter how dangerous the situation, or unpleasant the person, Boyd would end up coming out on top somehow.

                    Some say that he's got the luck of demons on his side, while others think he's just a weirdly uncanny guy with a lot of potential. If anything, for him, effort was hard to come by, and desire even harder.

                    Over the years, everything good in his life fell into his lap. After his father passed away (the 'Best damn thing the old man ever did,' by Boyd's own admission,) he decided to take up the traveler's torch and wander the world aimlessly.

                    Boyd is characterized by his deep disdain for his luck. Regardless of the amount of effort he puts forward in any given endeavor, he always succeeds. As a result, he feels most of his accomplishments are entirely unearned and largely pointless.

                    Were it not for the people in his life that he tries to hold onto despite this, his path would be considerably darker.
