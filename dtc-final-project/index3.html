                "Eons ago, a cataclysmic event shook existence to its core, reducing all of reality into a single point. All of creation, or perhaps what was left of it, coalesced into this primordial essence.
                In time, this essence would develop into a formless will, which was not unlike a child's first words. This will, aware of its own ignorance, decided it needed to learn more.
                Having naught but faint memories of countless lives unlived, the will, now calling itself Eid, came to understand its own limitless potential amidst the silent screams of the void.
                Eid soon realized that it was alone. Despite its unbridled power, it was unable to create anything with such limited space.
                So Eid, accepting its loneliness, willed itself away, succumbing its knowledge to nothingness. In that nothingness, the seed of knowledge bloomed into the very heart of existence.
                And thus, the Eidleik came to be."

                The Eidleik (eth-lake) is the eponymous center of the universe which connects each individual world with each other. While these worlds cannot normally interact with one another, the Eidleik's connections, simply called 'roots', allow for the perpetual exchange of life.
                The roots continually transfer 'information' to each world, which includes everything from souls to ancient memories. As with roots as we know them in our world, the connection between each root varies greatly.

                In worlds with weak connections to the Eidleik, information enters, but doesn't leave. This contributes to certain paranormal phenomena manifestations.

                In worlds with extremely weak roots, this allows for the proliferation and use of what is traditionally known as magic to be used. 

                A majority of the stories in this shared existence take place in worlds with weaker connections as a result.

                The setting of Telna takes place on an entirely disconnected world, adrift in a state known as 'ennui'. Ennui worlds are separated from the Eidleik forcefully, for a variety of reasons. In Telna's case, it serves as a prison for individuals who achieved immortality, and became Dragons.

                Dragons are not traditional 'dragons' in the sense of species or appearance; rather, individuals whose souls' connection is severed with the Eidleik lose the ability to age, but it comes at a terrible price.

                As the flow of information from the Eidleik ceases to interact with a soul, that soul disperses its own latent information slowly, while the body undergoes radical physical changes as a result.
