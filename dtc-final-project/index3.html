                "Eons ago, a cataclysmic event shook existence to its core, reducing all of reality into a single point.
                All of creation, or perhaps what was left of it, coalesced into this primordial essence.

                In time, this essence would develop into a formless will, which was not unlike a child's first words.
                This will, aware of its own ignorance, decided it needed to learn more.

                Having naught but faint memories of countless lives unlived, the will, now calling itself Eid, came to
                understand its own limitless potential amidst the silent screams of the void.

                Eid soon realized that it was alone. Despite its unbridled power, it was unable to create anything with
                such limited space.

                So Eid, accepting its loneliness, willed itself away, succumbing its knowledge to nothingness. In that
                nothingness, the seed of knowledge bloomed into the very heart of existence.

                And thus, the Eidleik came to be."

                The Eidleik (eth-lake) is the eponymous center of the universe which connects each individual world with
                each other. While these worlds cannot normally interact with one another, the Eidleik's connections,
                simply called 'roots', allow for the perpetual exchange of life.

                The roots continually transfer 'information' to each world, which includes everything from souls to
                ancient memories. As with roots as we know them in our world, the connection between each root varies
                greatly.

                In worlds with weak connections to the Eidleik, information enters, but doesn't leave. This contributes
                to certain paranormal phenomena manifestations (ghosts, spirits, etc.)

                In worlds with extremely weak roots, this allows for the proliferation and use of what is traditionally
                known as magic.

                A majority of the stories in this shared existence take place in worlds with weaker connections as a
                result.

                The setting of Telna takes place on an entirely disconnected world, adrift in a state known as 'ennui'.
                Ennui worlds are separated from the Eidleik forcefully, for a variety of reasons. In Telna's case, it
                serves as a prison for individuals who achieved immortality, and became Dragons.

                Dragons are not traditional 'dragons' in the sense of species or appearance; rather, individuals whose
                souls' connection is severed with the Eidleik lose the ability to age, but it comes at a terrible price.

                As the flow of information from the Eidleik ceases to interact with a soul, that soul disperses its own
                latent information slowly, while the body undergoes radical physical changes as a result.

                This transformation is a permanent corruption of the body, warping it beyond recognition. The longer
                this corruption remains intact, the worse it gets for the individual in question.

                Dragons are not inherently evil despite this corruption. Certain dragons have been in existence almost
                as long as time itself. Others are victims of circumstance, curiosity, or both.

                Much like a nervous system reacting to an infection, the Eidleik does its best to filter this
                corruption, so as to not damage the integrity of its connections. Some dragons, such as Kalzakkotz,
                actively assist in this endeavor.

                Others, such as Kei, work outside of the Eidleik's broader influence, attempting to ensure stability in
                the process of recycling this information.

                Telna used to simply be a sort of 'prison planet' for dragons to be filtered to, as its lack of
                connection to the Eidleik meant their corruption could have no effect on the overall distribution of
                information.

                However, a certain mortal individual discovered not only how to traverse across the roots, but also how
                to create temporary connections to worlds that were not there before. By utilizing a theory similar to the
                astronomical 'slingshot' principle (that is, using the gravity of a large astral body to accelerate, or
                'slingshot' a smaller body away from it,) this individual was able to send his body and soul alike to a
                different plane.

                This experimental success led him to use his own children as a hypothesis for his theories on the soul, and its nature.
                His efforts culminated in his own intentional severance of his connection to the Eidleik, and his summary transformation into a dragon.
                As punishment, he was sent to Telna, whereupon he utilized his knowledge to spread out his own information, not unlike the Eidleik. 

                Telna, once a barren wasteland, soon bore life over the ages, which this dragon tendered. He came not to see himself as a god, but an individual whose hypothesis was finally proven true.
                The ramifications of life being fostered on Telna had dire consequences, however. With the flow of new information, dormant dragons began to awaken. Their own information, seeded with eons of solitude, slowly began to spread their corruption.
                Unusual flora and fauna began to spread. 'Monsters', as they were called. Whispers of power long unclaimed echoed in the minds of the able. 
                And in their time of need, the dragon who had fostered life on the world was nowhere to be seen.

                These are the events which lead into the world as we know it today.
