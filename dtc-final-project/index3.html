                "Eons ago, a cataclysmic event shook existence to its core, reducing all of reality into a single point. All of creation, or perhaps what was left of it, coalesced into this primordial essence.
                In time, this essence would develop into a formless will, which was not unlike a child's first words. This will, aware of its own ignorance, decided it needed to learn more.
                Having naught but faint memories of countless lives unlived, the will, now calling itself Eid, came to understand its own limitless potential amidst the silent screams of the void.
                Eid soon realized that it was alone. Despite its unbridled power, it was unable to create anything with such limited space.
                So Eid, accepting its loneliness, willed itself away, succumbing its knowledge to nothingness. In that nothingness, the seed of knowledge bloomed into the very heart of existence.
                And thus, the Eidleik came to be."

                - Scripture 1:5 - Solitude

                The Eidleik (eth-lake) is the eponymous center of the universe which connects each individual world with each other. While these worlds cannot normally interact with one another, the Eidleik's connections, simply called 'roots', allow for the perpetual exchange of life.
                The roots continually transfer 'information' to each world,

                This is an example of how a really long, drawn out paragraph will look like when accompanied by an
                image, likely that of an expositionary display of a complex concept or idea.

                overwritten with text that actually explains what you're looking at, especially since it may be
                confusing to people who have no idea what it is.
