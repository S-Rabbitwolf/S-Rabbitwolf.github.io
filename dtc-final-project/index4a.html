                    When it comes to inspiration, there are very few things that you can point to as the sole, individual reason why they affected me so much.
                    I grew up in the 90's, which many would consider to be some of the best years fantasy media had, considering the advent of 64-bit consoles like the Playstation and Nintendo 64.
                    I would spend most of my time after school or during time off playing Roleplaying Games, which is actually how I learned to read and write English.
                    One game in particular stands out to me as the most influential in terms of how it shaped my appreciation for complex topics and aesthetics. 
                    That game is Final Fantasy Tactics.

                    I find it somewhat ironic that Japanese games over those formative years informed much of my aesthetic tastes, given how I grew up in a proper English household in the first place. 
                    However, it never really occurred to me until much later in my life just how wide that sphere of influence was on me. I found myself wanting to read and write in accordance with the things I loved so much.
                    If anything, I can attribute RPG's to far more than just my aesthetic appreciation. Concepts that seem silly to think about in a serious context like 'justice' and 'truth' are often indicative of things like shounen tropes.
                    However, I believe in the importance of relying on other people, embracing hope, and staying true to yourself regardless of the hardships you face. Games just had that profound of an effect on me, but I couldn't tell you why.

                    It was my love for games that put creation forward to me, but I found that the unbridled passion of other creators for their own work was enough to keep me going in particularly dark times.
                    Perhaps my biggest inspiration in this regard is Daisuke Ishiwatari, the creator and character designer of the Guilty Gear series. Combining Japanese shounen design archetypes and tropes with mid-high fantasy elements, I became enamored with his work around the early 2010's. 
                    More than anything, I just respect how he wears his inspirations on his sleeve. Most of the characters in his story are directly based off of musicians, albums, musical concepts, you name it. And people love it! It made me feel less like I was being derivative, myself.
                    I think the most important aspect of creating anything is knowing that someone's done what you're trying to do before. You just need to make it your own.

                    So by examining the things I really enjoyed, I came to appreciate my own work a lot more. As time passed, I found even more things I enjoyed, like fighting games (in particular, pretty niche anime fighters.)
                    It was by participating in these communities that I came to understand people a lot more. 
                    I was a bit of a recluse back when I started playing games competitively. After dealing with years of a pretty poor public school life, I had started to dislike the prospect of interacting with people very much.
                    Eventually, I managed to push myself beyond my limits by striving to be more than I was. In 2018, I managed to make Top 4 at a major competition with over 400 entrants in Las Vegas. 
                    The amount of love and support I got after that moment stays with me even today.

                <p>After leaving fighting games, I'm still friends with those people. I still have active conversations about character designs, art, music, all of that jazz.
                    So sometimes, I end up wondering, 'what if I had stuck with that?' Would I still have been happy today? Would I have ended up hating something I really enjoyed?
                    When I was younger, I definitely thought so. Today, I realize that the only thing to do when you feel tired of what you enjoy is to broaden your horizons, rather than put down what you love.
