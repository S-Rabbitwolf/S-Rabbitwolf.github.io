                    My name is S! Rather, that's obviously not my real name, but it is what I decide to go by around the expansive space that is the internet.
                I've had my fair share of notable escapades among circles I've been a part of, primarily in regards to things like fighting games of the niche anime variety.
                In fact, I used to play fighting games at a competitive level to moderate amounts of success! I've enjoyed countless opportunities when it comes to fighting games, but that phase of my life has been over for a while now.

                    These days, I'm far more invested in my creative outlets, e.g. drawing or writing. I've had various concepts swimming around in my braincase for quite a few years now!
                It's fairly obvious where my creative inspirations come from, at any rate. I grew up among the SNES/PS1 era of games, which meant a lot of reading, and a lot of mentally filling in the blanks.
                In fact, I attribute much of my creative acumen to games like Final Fantasy Tactics, the Shin Megami Tensei and Disgaea series, and much more. It's pretty blatantly obvious if you pay attention to any of my visual or outfit designs.

                    However, that isn't to say those were the only prevalent examples. I've always been a fan of incorporating a diverse, interconnected world that has many autonomous, independent parts to it.
                In a lot of ways, that's kind of how real life works. There are an incredible amount of people on our own world, each with their own stories and struggles regardless of the content of their character.
                In that way, I feel there are few things more important than creating concepts that resonate with these people, regardless of how fantastical the element may be.

                      In general, I feel that the most important thing any artist can do is to draw, or write, or theorize... you name it. The only thing that prevents you from being able to engage in your own world is yourself.
                Even if it's embarrassing or not even particularly very good, it's yours. That's the rub, realy. You can think my world sucks, that it's filled with a bunch of incoherent offshoot derivative rambling posing as a cohesive narrative.

                And honestly, you'd probably be right!

                <p>That doesn't make it any less important to me, though. If anything, knowing something isn't the best it could be is the most fun aspect of writing in particular.
                What kind of action writer doesn't want to have their content kick ass? What kind of horror writer doesn't want their content to be terrifying? None at all, I'd say!

                I kinda feel like that's the point of my life, believe it or not. And why I'm here, writing this webpage now. It's all just a continual cycle of improvement in spite of yourself.

                And, well, you decided you wanted to learn more about me. That's all there is to it. Besides the fact that I'm a horrible people pleaser with too little time on their hands.

                Oh well! I'm glad to be here. I'm glad you're reading this!</p>
