                <h2>Watching Over All Nothing</h2>
                <p>Kei and his partner Azusa are a symbiotic pair of deity and dragon, respectively. Kei ascended to godhood as a direct result of Azusa's intervention in saving his life roughly 3,000 years ago.

                    As stewards and protectors of the Eidleik and each soul which flows into and out of it, they have lived a solitary existence in the center of the universe since their union.

                    Kei is directly responsible for the punishment of new dragons, and he is charged with personally intercepting and eliminating them as they arise, through one means or another.

                    Of course, it can't be ignored that Azusa herself is a dragon. Azusa's transformation happened far before Kei's time, yet she acts just as brash as she was when she was mortal, besides.

                    Despite their differences, they are truly of one mind and body. Azusa is capable of separating her corporeal form into distinct segments and parts. As an example, she is often partial to being Kei's cloak, scythe, or extra set of limbs.

                    Both of them understand their duty far more than anyone else could despite their clashing personalities. Kei in particular is prone to creating artificial bodies to scout worlds that are on the brink of destruction, or investigate individuals who may be close to converting into dragons.

                    These days, the Eidleik is in relative balance with output and input. However, one specific incident regarding a mortal who voluntarily breached the roots of the Eidleik caught the two's attention.

                    Even worse, that mortal's daughter had managed to not only do the same, but arrive at the center of the Eidleik in an attempt to bring a loved one back to life... despite the fact that her soul was on the brink of shattering to pieces.

                    To prevent this girl from dissipating at the seams, Kei took pity on her, and sealed her soul in an artificial body after she proved her worth. For now, that body, known as Setra, operates in tandem with Kei and Azusa to avert disaster, until the woman's soul can fully heal.
