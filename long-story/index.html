    The Hindenburg Disaster
</h1></div>
<h2>Another Titan Falls</h2>

<section id="storytime1">
    <div class="textinside"><p>On May 6, 1937, the German airship LZ 129 Hindenburg met an untimely end, claiming the lives of 35 people. One of the most infamous examples of an aviation disaster in the 20th century, the Hindenburg was primed for misfortune from the start.</p></div>
</section>

<section id="storytime2">
    <div class="textinside"><p>The Hindenburg was a novelty for its time, as rather than the standard payload of helium to travel (largely due to the United States' ban of helium exports to Germany,) it was instead filled with hydrogen, which is known for its flammable reactivity. Due to its massive size, a lightweight mixture of paint covered the Hindenburg, which is theorized to have accelerated the blaze.</p> </div>
</section>

<section id="storytime3">
    <div class="textinside"><p>The Hindenburg was lowering for a routine landing at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey at approximately 7:11PM. Over the next fifteen minutes, the airship would lower from its 650 foot altitude, all the way down to 295 feet. All the while, a slow flame would erupt into a blazing inferno.</p></div>
</section>

<section id="storytime4">
    <div class="textinside"><p>At 7:25 PM, the Hindenburg would visibly ignite along its portside, and it would disintegrate in mere seconds. The hydrogen, combined with the flammable coat of lightweight paint, fueled the initial explosion, cascading its metal frame to the ground. In about 20 seconds, all that remained was the burning metal husk of a titan of industry.</p> </div>
</section>

<section id="storytime5">
    <div class="textinside2"><p>35 people lost their lives, but dozens of others would be saved by Naval personel and emergency responders. The Hindenburg's demise essentially gutted the concept of commercial airship traversal, and spelled doom for the airship industry as a whole. Commercial aviation would soon take its place, but the effects of the Hindenburg's demise were felt for decades still.</p> </div>
