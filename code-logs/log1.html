	<h1 id="title">Utilization of HTML Semantic Elements</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="assignment1">
            Semantic arguments in terms of HTML prompts are in the name. The nature of semantic arguments denotes that they define the content of what it entails.
            For example, the img tag is semantic due to its use as an identifier for images on a page. Non-semantic arguments, like div, h(x) etc. do not denote specific content.
			There are two main benefits to utilizing semantic tags. The first is that you are able to much more easily identify information you notate in your code. 
			By assigning semantic identifiers to your code, you will be able to utilize search methods to find your code. For example:
			<h3 class=demonstration>
				<textarea><h1 class=small>Insert text here.</h1>
				<h2 class=large>Insert text here.</h2></textarea>
			</h3>
			By assigning classes to your work, you'll be able to find it much easier in the future.
			The second use is that semantic arguments allow you to utilize individual elements, like images, articles, links, and more.
			For example. An image tag can also be anchored to a link, making the image be clickable to take you somewhere else. In this instance, it will take you to
            the location of the file itself on imgur.com.

            <a href="https://i.imgur.com/iJBDdDO.png"><img class="goodboy" id="DogMage" src="SaiMage1.png" width="620" height="1200" alt="This art was created by Mencho as a commission. I designed the character myself! @MEN_cho7 on twitter."> </a>
            <div class="hovertext">
				<div class="text">This art was created by @MEN_cho7 on Twitter.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
            <caption class="caption">An example of an image being posted with the img tag, which will take you directly to the standalone image. Did you hover over it? You may learn something. </caption>
			<h2>In order to accomplish this, the use of a combination of anchor and img tags is necessary.
			For example: 
			<h3 class="demonstration"><textarea><a href="https://i.imgur.com/iJBDdDO.png"><img class="goodboy" id="DogMage" src="SaiMage1.png" width="620" height="1200" alt="This art was created by Mencho as a commission. I designed the character myself! @MEN_cho7 on twitter."> </a></textarea></h2>
			As you can see, the image is anchored with a link to a full resolution version on the web. The image has been drastically resized from 2480x4802 with the width and height tags.</h2>
			<br>
			That all being said, there's plenty available to allow for additional input with CSS methodology. That's for next time, though. 
            In short, you can think of it like this. The non-semantic arguments give the page a skeleton, and the semantic arguments utilize that skeleton to display content.
            This information can be combined to give the website its basic shape and structure. These elements can be combined at will, with minimal restriction.
