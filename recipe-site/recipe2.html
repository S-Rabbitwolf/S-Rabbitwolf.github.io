		<p>A particularly aggressively southern seafood endowment!   
         Fried Shrimp is a simple pleasure, combining the best parts of food there is (that being fried seafood) into something absolutely delicious by every metric.
		 Being able to handle fried food such as shrimp is child's play, but it can be tricky to get right!

			<h2 id="ingredients">What You'll Need:</h2>
			<ul>		
				<li>1 lb of deveined raw shrimp</li>
				<li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>1 &half; tbsp salt</li>
				<li>&half; tsp black pepper</li>
				<li>2 tsp granulated garlic</li>
				<li>2 tsp paprika</li>
				<li>2 tsp oregano</li>
				<li>&half; cup of whole milk</li>
				<li>Your preference of frying oil</li>
			</ul>
            <div class="preparationtext">
			<h2 id="instructions">Instructions:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>CLEAN YOUR SHRIMP! It's very important that you make sure your shrimp is properly cleaned before you prepare it!</li>
				<li>Mix the milk, half a teaspoon of salt, and 1 tsp of oregano, paprika, and granulated garlic with the shirmp in a large bowl, allowing it to sit for 10 minutes.</li>
				<li>Season the flour with the remaining seasonings (the salt, paprika, pepper, etc.)</li>
				<li>Remove the shrimp from the milk mixture, placing it in the flour and coating it well. Make sure you don't see any fleshy bits underneath!</li>
				<li>Fry the shrimp for 3-4 minutes in oil at around 375 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The great thing about shrimp is that despite how easy it is to mess up in terms of breading it, it still remains a quality item despite that. It's very easy to salvage shrimp into something useful, so be sure to keep that in mind!

			<h2 id="authornotes">A little bit about why I like this stuff so much:</h2>
			<p>Growing up in the south (specifically Northern Texas,) it became pretty much a weekly ritual to have some kind of fried food, given the community I had grown up in. While it's hard to beat something like properly fried and seasoned chicken,
				I find that it's extremely hard to beat properly cooked seafood of any kind. I was always particular to shrimp, due to the huge varieties in methods to cook and prepare it, so it's natural that I'd want to feature it here. I'm glad I did, because it's absolutely stellar!
