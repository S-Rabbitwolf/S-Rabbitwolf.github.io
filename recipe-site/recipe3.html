		<p>My absolute favorite desert, a staple in the American household, and a particular favorite in northern Texas. (Just don't tell that to Peach Cobbler enjoyers.)
			One of the easier pies to make due to its simplicity in ingredients and content, it makes up for its prep time with a flavor that is impossible to forget.

			<h2 id="ingredients">What You'll Need:</h2>
			<ul>		
				<li>2 9" pie crusts</li>
				<li>7 large apples, preferably along the lines of Granny Smith, peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
				<li>&half; cup granulated sugar</li>
				<li>&half; cup light brown sugar</li>
				<li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
				<li>&frac18; tsp ground nutmeg</li>
				<li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
				<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
				<li>2 tbsp sanding sugar (this one's optional)</li>
			</ul>
            <div class="preparationtext">
			<h2 id="instructions">Instructions:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Start by gathering 2 9" pie crusts, either by making them yourself, or with a store-bought arrangement. Either works!</li>
				<li>Make sure to preheat the oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
				<li>Combine the apples, sugars, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice/zest into a bowl, and toss it so it's evenly coated.</li>
				<li>Roll the pie crust dough into a 12" circle at about &frac18;" inch thickness, and put it on the bottom of a deep dish pie plate.</li>
				<li>Evenly distribute the filling you had combined previously onto the bottom crust, discarding the excess juices into the bowl, while layering a &frac14;" thick dough lining for the top.</li>
				<li>Trim the dough along the pie plate's edge with a knife. Use this opportunity to press the edges of the top and bottom pie crusts together, merging them.</li>
				<li>Place the pie onto a baking sheet, and brush the pie crust with that beaten egg wash to ensure consistency. Make sure to shield the edges of the pie with foil!</li>
				<li>Bake it at 400 degrees fahrenheit for 25 minutes, then remove the pie shielding. Turn the oven down to 375, and bake it for 30-35 minutes more.</li>
				<li>Let it cool down for about 3 hours, and enjoy!</li>

			</ol>
			<p>It's a lot of meticulous preparation, but the end result is worth it. Make sure to refridgerate it for later! Some people prefer apple pie when it's cold. It's quite funny to think about.

			<h2 id="authornotes">A little bit about why I like this stuff so much:</h2>
			<p>Appie pie is a unique bit of comfort food for me. It's something that my mother would prepare from time to time using pre-made materials due to her financial situation. It didn't really matter, because making it was something I truly enjoyed.
				In the end, it can be combined with things like ice cream to make it even better, which is something southerners especially love to do with it. It's been a while since I've had it myself, so I think I'll give it a try sometime real soon!
